    <p2 align="right" style="color:firebrick;font-family: cursive">he is the favorite child because he likes the color red, which is a different hue of my favorite color, orange.
        Huey was born to Sratchcats dotMIT's ex-wife, Donald Duck, who also loves and appreciates Huey with her heart and soul. 
        He goes to MIT as a duck, so far, he's been successful in his endevours as a duck major. Huey shows much promise for 
        the family legacy.

    <p6 style="color:midnightblue;font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px">Dewey is the second child, the most average one of the flock. A straight B student,
    Dewey did not achieve his brother's standard of MIT and ended up becoming a buisness major at Arizona State. He is loved averagly by his mother and father,
    although divorced, still agreed that he was horribly average and would amount to an average man. Still shows decent promise in his future
    to take on his brother's legacy as the best duck ever.</p6>
